# Swift Distributed Tracing

A Distributed Tracing API for Swift.

This is a collection of Swift libraries enabling the instrumentation of server side applications using tools such as tracers. Our goal is to provide a common foundation that allows to freely choose how to instrument systems with minimal changes to your actual code.

While Swift Distributed Tracing allows building all kinds of _instruments_, which can co-exist in applications transparently, its primary use is instrumenting multi-threaded and distributed systems with Distributed Traces.

## Compatibility

This project is designed in a very open and extensible manner, such that various instrumentation and tracing systems can be built on top of it. 

The purpose of the tracing package is to serve as common API for all tracer and instrumentation implementations. Thanks to this, libraries may only need to be instrumented once, and then be used with any tracer which conforms to this API.

## Getting Started

In this short getting started example, we'll go through bootstrapping, immediately benefiting from tracing, and instrumenting our own synchronous and asynchronous APIs. The following sections will explain all the pieces of the API in more depth. When in doubt, you may want to refer to the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io), [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io), or [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io) documentations because all the concepts for different tracers are quite similar. 

### Dependencies & Tracer backend

In order to use tracing you will need to bootstrap a tracing backend ([available backends](#backends)). 

When developing an *application* locate the specific tracer library you would like to use and add it as an dependency directly:

```swift
.package(url: "<https://example.com/some-awesome-tracer-backend.git", from: "..."),
```

Alternatively, or when developing a *library/framework*, you should not depend on a specific tracer, and instead only depend on the tracing package directly, by adding the following to your `Package.swift`:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing.git", from: "0.1.0"),
```

To your main target, add a dependency on `Tracing` library and the instrument you want to use:

```swift
.target(
    name: "MyApplication", 
    dependencies: [
        "Tracing",
        "<AwesomeTracing>", // the specific tracer
    ]
),
```

Then (in an application, libraries should _never_ invoke `bootstrap`), you will want to bootstrap the specific tracer you want to use in your application. A `Tracer` is a type of `Instrument` and can be offered used to globally bootstrap the tracing system, like this:


```swift
import Tracing // the tracing API
import AwesomeTracing // the specific tracer

InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(AwesomeTracing())
```

If you don't bootstrap  (or other instrument) the default no-op tracer is used, which will result in no trace data being collected.

### Benefiting from instrumented libraries/frameworks

**Automatically reported spans**: When using an already instrumented library, e.g. an HTTP Server which automatically emits spans internally, this is all you have to do to enable tracing. It should now automatically record and emit spans using your configured backend.

**Using baggage and logging context**: The primary transport type for tracing metadata is called `Baggage`, and the primary type used to pass around baggage context and loggers is `LoggingContext`. Logging context combines baggage context values with a smart `Logger` that automatically includes any baggage values ("trace metadata") when it is used for logging. For example, when using an instrumented HTTP server, the API could look like this:

```swift
SomeHTTPLibrary.handle { (request, context) in 
  context.logger.info("Wow, tracing!") // automatically includes tracing metadata such as "trace-id"
  return try doSomething(request context: context)
}
```

In this snippet, we use the context logger to log a very useful message. However it is even more useful than it seems at first sight: if a tracer was installed and extracted tracing information from the incoming request, it would automatically log our message _with_ the trace information, allowing us to co-relate all log statements made during handling of this specific request:

```
05:46:38 example-trace-id=1111-23-1234556 info: Wow tracing!
05:46:38 example-trace-id=9999-22-9879797 info: Wow tracing!
05:46:38 example-trace-id=9999-22-9879797 user=Alice info: doSomething() for user Alice
05:46:38 example-trace-id=1111-23-1234556 user=Charlie info: doSomething() for user Charlie
05:46:38 example-trace-id=1111-23-1234556 user=Charlie error: doSomething() could not complete request!
05:46:38 example-trace-id=9999-22-9879797 user=alice info: doSomething() completed
```

Thanks to tracing, and trace identifiers, even if not using tracing visualization libraries, we can immediately co-relate log statements and know that the request `1111-23-1234556` has failed. Since our application can also _add_ values to the context, we can quickly notice that the error seems to occur for the user `Charlie` and not for user `Alice`. Perhaps the user Charlie has exceeded some quotas, does not have permissions or we have a bug in parsing names that include the letter `h`? We don't know _yet_, but thanks to tracing we can much quicker begin our investigation.

**Passing context to client libraries**: When using client libraries that support distributed tracing, they will accept a `Baggage.LoggingContext` type as their _last_ parameter in many calls.

When using client libraries that support distributed tracing, they will accept a `Baggage.LoggingContext` type as their _last_ parameter in many calls. Please refer to [Context argument naming/positioning](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing/tree/wip-readme-release#context-propagation-by-explicit-loggingcontext-passing) in the [Context propagation](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing/tree/wip-readme-release#context-propagation-by-explicit-loggingcontext-passing) section of this readme to learn more about how to properly pass context values around.

### Instrumenting your code

Adding a span to synchronous functions can be achieved like this:

```swift
func handleRequest(_ op: String, context: LoggingContext) -> String {
  let tracer = InstrumentationSystem.tracer
  let span = tracer.startSpan(operationName: "handleRequest(\(name))", context: context)
  defer { span.end() }
  
  return "done:\(op)"
}
```

Throwing can be handled by either recording errors manually into a span by calling `span.recordError(error:)`, or by wrapping a potentially throwing operation using the `withSpan(operation:context:body:)` function, which automatically records any thrown error and ends the span at the end of the body closure scope:

```swift
func handleRequest(_ op: String, context: LoggingContext) -> String {
  return try InstrumentationSystem.tracer
        .withSpan(operationName: "handleRequest(\(name))", context: context) {
    return try dangerousOperation() 
  }
}
```

If this function were asynchronous, and returning a [Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) `EventLoopFuture`,
we need to end the span when the future completes. We can do so in its `onComplete`:

```swift
func handleRequest(_ op: String, context: LoggingContext) -> EventLoopFuture<String> {
  let tracer = InstrumentationSystem.tracer
  let span = tracer.startSpan(operationName: "handleRequest(\(name))", context: context)
  
  let future: EventLoopFuture<String> = someOperation(op)
  future.whenComplete { _ in 
    span.end() // oh no, ignored errors!
  }
  
  return future
}
```

This is better, however we ignored the possibility that the future perhaps has failed. If this happens, we would like to report the span as _errored_ because then it will show up as such in tracing backends and we can then easily search for failed operations etc.

To do this within the future we could manually invoke the `span.recordError` API before ending the span like this:

```swift
func handleRequest(_ op: String, context: LoggingContext) -> EventLoopFuture<String> {
  let tracer = InstrumentationSystem.tracer
  let span = tracer.startSpan(operationName: "handleRequest(\(name))", context: context)

  let future: EventLoopFuture<String> = someOperation(op)
  future.whenComplete { result in
    switch result {
    case .failure(let error): span.recordError(error)
    case .success(let value): // ... record additional *attributes* into the span
    }
    span.end()
  }

  return future
}
```

While this is verbose, this is only the low-level building blocks that this library provides, higher level helper utilities can be  

> Eventually convenience wrappers will be provided, automatically wrapping future types etc. We welcome such contributions, but likely they should live in `swift-distributed-tracing-extras`.

Once a system, or multiple systems have been instrumented, a Tracer been selected and your application runs and emits some trace information, you will be able to inspect how your application is behaving by looking at one of the various trace UIs, such as e.g. Zipkin:

![Simple example trace in Zipkin Web UI](images/zipkin_trace.png)

### More examples

It sometimes is easier to grasp the usage of tracing by looking at a "real" application - which is why we have implemented an example application, spanning multiple nodes and using various databases - tracing through all of them. You can view the example application here: [slashmo/swift-tracing-examples](https://github.com/slashmo/swift-tracing-examples/tree/main/hotrod).

### Future work: Tracing asynchronous functions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This section refers to in-development upcoming Swift Concurrency features and can be tried out using nightly snapshots of the Swift toolchain.

With Swift's ongoing work towards asynchronous functions, actors, and tasks, tracing in Swift will become more pleasant than it is today.

Firstly, a lot of the callback heavy code will be folded into normal control flow, which is easy and correct to integrate with tracing like this:

```swift
func perform(context: LoggingContext) async -> String { 
  let span = InstrumentationSystem.tracer.startSpan(operationName: #function, context: context)
  defer { span.end() }
  
  return await someWork()
}
```


## In-Depth Guide

When instrumenting server applications there are typically three parties involved:

1. [Application developers](#application-developers-setting-up-instruments) creating server-side applications
2. [Library/Framework developers](#libraryframework-developers-instrumenting-your-software) providing building blocks to create these applications
3. [Instrument developers](#instrument-developers-creating-an-instrument) providing tools to collect distributed metadata about your application

For applications to be instrumented correctly these three parts have to play along nicely.

## Application Developers

### Setting up instruments & tracers

As an end-user building server applications you get to choose what instruments to use to instrument your system. Here's
all the steps you need to take to get up and running:

Add a package dependency for this repository in your `Package.swift` file, and one for the specific instrument you want
to use, in this case `FancyInstrument`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing.git", .branch("main")),
.package(url: "<https://repo-of-fancy-instrument.git>", from: "<4.2.0>"),
```

To your main target, add a dependency on the `Instrumentation library` and the instrument you want to use:

```swift
.target(
    name: "MyApplication", 
    dependencies: [
        "FancyInstrument"
    ]
),
```

### Bootstrapping the `InstrumentationSystem`

Instead of providing each instrumented library with a specific instrument explicitly, you *bootstrap* the
`InstrumentationSystem` which acts as a singleton that libraries/frameworks access when calling out to the configured
`Instrument`:

```swift
InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(FancyInstrument())
```

#### Recommended bootstrap order

Swift offers developers a suite of observability libraries: logging, metrics and tracing. Each of those systems offers a `bootstrap` function. It is useful to stick to a recommended boot order in order to achieve predictable initialization of applications and sub-systems.

Specifically, it is recommended to bootstrap systems in the following order:

1. [Swift Log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log#default-logger-behavior)'s `LoggingSystem`
2. [Swift Metrics](https://github.com/apple/swift-metrics#selecting-a-metrics-backend-implementation-applications-only)' `MetricsSystem`
3. Swift Tracing's `InstrumentationSystem`
4. Finally, any other parts of your application

This is because tracing systems may attempt to emit metrics about their status etc. 

#### Bootstrapping multiple instruments using MultiplexInstrument

It is important to note that `InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(_: Instrument)` must only be called once. In case you
want to bootstrap the system to use multiple instruments, you group them in a `MultiplexInstrument` first, which you
then pass along to the `bootstrap` method like this:

```swift
InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(MultiplexInstrument([FancyInstrument(), OtherFancyInstrument()]))
```

`MultiplexInstrument` will then call out to each instrument it has been initialized with.


<a name="passing-context-objects"></a>
### Context propagation, by explicit `LoggingContext` passing

> `LoggingContext` naming has been carefully selected and it reflects the type's purpose and utility: It binds a [Swift Log `Logger`](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) with an associated distributed tracing [Baggage](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage).
> 
> It _also_ is used for tracing, by tracers reaching in to read or modify the carried baggage. 

For instrumentation and tracing to work, certain pieces of metadata (usually in the form of identifiers), must be
carried throughout the entire system‚Äìincluding across process and service boundaries. Because of that, it's essential
for a context object to be passed around your application and the libraries/frameworks you depend on, but also carried
over asynchronous boundaries like an HTTP call to another service of your app.

`LoggingContext` should always be passed around explicitly.

Libraries which support tracing are expected to accept a `LoggingContext` parameter, which can be passed through the entire application. Make sure to always pass along the context that's previously handed to you. E.g., when making an HTTP request using `AsyncHTTPClient` in a `NIO` handler, you can use the `ChannelHandlerContext`s `baggage` property to access the `LoggingContext`.

#### Context argument naming/positioning

> üí° This general style recommendation has been ironed out together with the Swift standard library, core team, the SSWG as well as members of the community. Please respect these recommendations when designing APIs such that all APIs are able to "feel the same" yielding a great user experience for our end users ‚ù§Ô∏è
> 
> It is possible that the ongoing Swift Concurrency efforts, and "Task Local" values will resolve this explicit context passing problem, however until these arrive in the language, please adopt the "context is the last parameter" style as outlined here.

Propagating baggage context through your system is to be done explicitly, meaning as a parameter in function calls, following the "flow" of execution.

When passing baggage context explicitly we strongly suggest sticking to the following style guideline:

- Assuming the general parameter ordering of Swift function is as follows (except DSL exceptions):
  1. Required non-function parameters (e.g. `(url: String)`),
  2. Defaulted non-function parameters (e.g. `(mode: Mode = .default)`),
  3. Required function parameters, including required trailing closures (e.g. `(onNext elementHandler: (Value) -> ())`),
  4. Defaulted function parameters, including optional trailing closures (e.g. `(onComplete completionHandler: (Reason) -> ()) = { _ in }`).
- Logging Context should be passed as **the last parameter in the required non-function parameters group in a function declaration**.

This way when reading the call side, users of these APIs can learn to "ignore" or "skim over" the context parameter and the method signature remains human-readable and ‚ÄúSwifty‚Äù.

Examples:

- `func request(_ url: URL,` **`context: LoggingContext`** `)`, which may be called as `httpClient.request(url, context: context)`
- `func handle(_ request: RequestObject,` **`context: LoggingContext`** `)`
  - if a "framework context" exists and _carries_ the baggage context already, it is permitted to pass that context
    together with the baggage;
  - it is _strongly recommended_ to store the baggage context as `baggage` property of `FrameworkContext`, and conform `FrameworkContext` to `LoggingContext` in such cases, in order to avoid the confusing spelling of `context.context`, and favoring the self-explanatory `context.baggage` spelling when the baggage is contained in a framework context object.
- `func receiveMessage(_ message: Message, context: FrameworkContext)`
- `func handle(element: Element,` **`context: LoggingContext`** `, settings: Settings? = nil)`
  - before any defaulted non-function parameters
- `func handle(element: Element,` **`context: LoggingContext`** `, settings: Settings? = nil, onComplete: () -> ())`
  - before defaulted parameters, which themselfes are before required function parameters
- `func handle(element: Element,` **`context: LoggingContext`** `, onError: (Error) -> (), onComplete: (() -> ())? = nil)`

In case there are _multiple_ "framework-ish" parameters, such as passing a NIO `EventLoop` or similar, we suggest:

- `func perform(_ work: Work, for user: User,` _`frameworkThing: Thing, eventLoop: NIO.EventLoop,`_ **`context: LoggingContext`** `)`
  - pass the baggage as **last** of such non-domain specific parameters as it will be _by far more_ omnipresent than any
    specific framework parameter - as it is expected that any framework should be accepting a context if it can do so.
    While not all libraries are necessarily going to be implemented using the same frameworks.

We feel it is important to preserve Swift's human-readable nature of function definitions. In other words, we intend to
keep the read-out-loud phrasing of methods to remain _"request that URL (ignore reading out loud the context parameter)"_
rather than _"request (ignore this context parameter when reading) that URL"_.

#### When to use what context type?

Generally libraries should favor accepting the general `LoggingContext` type, and **not** attempt to wrap it, as it will result in difficult to compose APIs between multiple libraries. Because end users are likely going to be combining various libraries in a single application, it is important that they can "just pass along" the same context object through all APIs, regardless which other library they are calling into.

Frameworks may need to be more opinionated here, and e.g. already have some form of "per request context" contextual object which they will conform to `LoggingContext`. _Within_ such framework it is fine and expected to accept and pass the explicit `SomeFrameworkContext`, however when designing APIs which may be called _by_ other libraries, such framework should be able to accept a generic `LoggingContext` rather than its own specific type.

#### Existing context argument

When adapting an existing library/framework to support `LoggingContext` and it already has a "framework context" which is expected to be passed through "everywhere", we suggest to follow these guidelines for adopting LoggingContext:

1. Add a `Baggage` as a property called `baggage` to your own `context` type, so that the call side for your
   users becomes `context.baggage` (rather than the confusing `context.context`)
2. If you cannot or it would not make sense to carry baggage inside your framework's context object, pass (and accept (!)) the `LoggingContext` in your framework functions like follows:
- if they take no framework context, accept a `context: LoggingContext` which is the same guideline as for all other cases
- if they already _must_ take a context object and you are out of words (or your API already accepts your framework context as "context"), pass the baggage as **last** parameter (see above) yet call the parameter `baggage` to disambiguate your `context` object from the `baggage` context object.

Examples:

- `Lamda.Context` may contain `baggage` and a `logger` and should be able to conform to `LoggingContext`
  - passing context to a `Lambda.Context` unaware library becomes: `http.request(url: "...", context: context)`.
- `ChannelHandlerContext` offers a way to set/get baggage on the underlying channel via `context.baggage = ...`
  - this context is not passed outside a handler, but within it may be passed as is, and the baggage may be accessed on it directly through it.
  - Example: https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/1574

### Creating context objects (and when not to do so)

Generally application developers _should not_ create new context objects, but rather keep passing on a context value that they were given by e.g. the web framework invoking the their code. 

If really necessary, or for the purposes of testing, one can create a baggage or context using one of the two factory functions:

- [`DefaultLoggingContext.topLevel(logger:)`](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage/blob/main/Sources/Baggage/LoggingContext.swift#L232-L259) or [`Baggage.topLevel`](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage-core/blob/main/Sources/CoreBaggage/Baggage.swift#L79-L103) - which creates an empty context/baggage, without any values. It should _not_ be used too frequently, and as the name implies in applications it only should be used on the "top level" of the application, or at the beginning of a contextless (e.g. timer triggered) event processing.
- [`DefaultLoggingContext.TODO(logger:reason:)`](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage/blob/main/Sources/Baggage/LoggingContext.swift#L262-L292) or [`Baggage.TODO`](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage-core/blob/main/Sources/CoreBaggage/Baggage.swift#L107-L136) - which should be used to mark a parameter where "before this code goes into production, a real context should be passed instead." An application can be run with `-DBAGGAGE_CRASH_TODOS` to cause the application to crash whenever a TODO context is still in use somewhere, making it easy to diagnose and avoid breaking context propagation by accidentally leaving in a `TODO` context in production.

Please refer to the respective functions documentation for details.

If using a framework which itself has a "`...Context`" object you may want to inspect it for similar factory functions, as `LoggingContext` is a protocol, that may be conformed to by frameworks to provide a smoother user experience.

<a name="spans"></a>
### Working with `Span`s

The primary purpose of this API is to start and end so-called `Span` types.

Spans form hierarchies with their parent spans, and end up being visualized using various tools, usually in a format similar to gant charts. So for example, if we had multiple operations that compose making dinner, they would be modelled as child spans of a main `makeDinner` span. Any sub tasks are again modelled as child spans of any given operation, and so on, resulting in a trace view similar to:

```
>-o-o-o----- makeDinner ----------------o---------------x    [15s]
  \-|-|- chopVegetables--------x        |                    [2s]
    | |  \- chop -x |                   |                    [1s]
    | |             \--- chop -x        |                    [1s]
    \-|- marinateMeat -----------x      |                    [3s]
      \- preheatOven -----------------x |                    [10s]
                                        \--cook---------x    [5s]
```

The above trace is achieved by starting and ending spans in all the mentioned functions, for example, like this:

```swift
let tracer: Tracer

func makeDinner(context: LoggingContext) async throws -> Meal {
  tracer.withSpan(operationName: "makeDinner", context) {
    let veggiesFuture = try chopVegetables(context: span.context)
    let meatFuture = marinateMeat(context: span.context)
    let ovenFuture = try preheatOven(temperature: 350, context: span.context)
    ...
    return cook(veggies, meat, oven)
  }
}
```

> ‚ùóÔ∏è It is tremendously important to **always `end()` a started `Span`**! make sure to end any started span on _every_ code path, including error paths 
> 
> Failing to do so is an error, and a tracer *may* decide to either crash the application or log warnings when an not-ended span is deinitialized.


## Library/Framework developers: Instrumenting your software

### Extracting & injecting Baggage

When hitting boundaries like an outgoing HTTP request you call out to the [configured instrument(s)](#Bootstrapping-the-Instrumentation-System):

An HTTP client e.g. should inject the given `LoggingContext` into the HTTP headers of its outbound request:

```swift
func get(url: String, context: LoggingContext) {
  var request = HTTPRequest(url: url)
  InstrumentationSystem.instrument.inject(
    context.baggage,
    into: &request.headers,
    using: HTTPHeadersInjector()
  )
}
```

On the receiving side, an HTTP server should use the following `Instrument` API to extract the HTTP headers of the given
`HTTPRequest` into:

```swift
func handler(request: HTTPRequest, context: LoggingContext) {
  InstrumentationSystem.instrument.extract(
    request.headers,
    into: &context.baggage,
    using: HTTPHeadersExtractor()
  )
  // ...
}
```

> In case your library makes use of the `NIOHTTP1.HTTPHeaders` type we already have an `HTTPHeadersInjector` &
`HTTPHeadersExtractor` available as part of the `NIOInstrumentation` library.

For your library/framework to be able to carry `LoggingContext` across asynchronous boundaries, it's crucial that you carry the context throughout your entire call chain in order to avoid dropping metadata.

### Tracing your library

When your library/framework can benefit from tracing, you should make use of it by integrating the `Tracing` library. 

In order to work with the tracer [configured by the end-user](#Bootstrapping-the-Instrumentation-System), it adds a property to `InstrumentationSystem` that gives you back a `Tracer`. You can then use that tracer to start `Span`s. In an HTTP client you e.g.
should start a `Span` when sending the outgoing HTTP request:

```swift
func get(url: String, context: LoggingContext) {
  var request = HTTPRequest(url: url)

  // inject the request headers into the baggage as explained above

  // start a span for the outgoing request
  let tracer = InstrumentationSystem.tracer
  var span = tracer.startSpan(named: "HTTP GET", context: context, ofKind: .client)

  // set attributes on the span
  span.attributes.http.method = "GET"
  // ...

  self.execute(request).always { _ in
    // set some more attributes & potentially record an error

    // end the span
    span.end()
  }
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to ALWAYS end spans. Ensure that all paths taken by the code will result in ending the span.
> Make sure that error cases also set the error attribute and end the span.

> In the above example we used the semantic `http.method` attribute that gets exposed via the
`TracingOpenTelemetrySupport` library.

## Instrument developers: Creating an instrument

Creating an instrument means adopting the `Instrument` protocol (or `Tracer` in case you develop a tracer).
`Instrument` is part of the `Instrumentation` library & `Tracing` contains the `Tracer` protocol.

`Instrument` has two requirements:

1. A method to inject values inside a `LoggingContext` into a generic carrier (e.g. HTTP headers)
2. A method to extract values from a generic carrier (e.g. HTTP headers) and store them in a `LoggingContext`

The two methods will be called by instrumented libraries/frameworks at asynchronous boundaries, giving you a chance to
act on the provided information or to add additional information to be carried across these boundaries.

> Check out the [`Baggage` documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage) for more information on
how to retrieve values from the `LoggingContext` and how to set values on it.

### Creating a `Tracer`

When creating a tracer you need to create two types:

1. Your tracer conforming to `Tracer`
2. A span class conforming to `Span`

> The `Span` conforms to the standard rules defined in [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/trace/api.md#span), so if unsure about usage patterns, you can refer to this specification and examples referring to it.

### Defining, injecting and extracting Baggage

```swift
import Tracing

private enum TraceIDKey: Baggage.Key {
  typealias Value = String
}

extension Baggage {
  var traceID: String? {
    get {
      return self[TraceIDKey.self]
    }
    set {
      self[TraceIDKey.self] = newValue
    }
  }
}

var context = DefaultLoggingContext.topLevel(logger: ...)
context.baggage.traceID = "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736"
print(context.baggage.traceID ?? "new trace id")
```

## Contributing

Please make sure to run the `./scripts/sanity.sh` script when contributing, it checks formatting and similar things.

You can ensure it always is run and passes before you push by installing a pre-push hook with git:

``` sh
echo './scripts/sanity.sh' > .git/hooks/pre-push
```

### Formatting 

We use a specific version of [`nicklockwood/swiftformat`](https://github.com/nicklockwood/swiftformat).
Please take a look at our [`Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile) to see which version is currently being used and install it
on your machine before running the script.
