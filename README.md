# Swift Distributed Tracing

A Distributed Tracing API for Swift.

This is a collection of Swift types enabling the instrumentation of server side applications using tools such as tracers. Our goal is to provide a common foundation that allows to freely choose how to instrument systems with minimal changes to your actual code.

While Swift Distributed Tracing allows building all kinds of _instruments_, which can co-exist in applications transparently, its primary use is instrumenting multi-threaded and distributed systems with Distributed Traces.

This project defines `TracingContext`, the context propagation type used to carry values across
concurrent Swift code. [swift-service-context](https://github.com/apple/swift-service-context) is a thin
compatibility package that keeps the type's former name, `ServiceContext`, working for existing adopters.

## Compatibility

This project is designed in a very open and extensible manner, such that various instrumentation and tracing systems can be built on top of it.

The purpose of the tracing package is to serve as common API for all tracer and instrumentation implementations. Thanks to this, libraries may only need to be instrumented once, and then be used with any tracer which conforms to this API.
