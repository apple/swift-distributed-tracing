/// A type that allows extracting values from an associated carrier.
///
/// The assocaited type, `Carrier`, is a service request such as an HTTP request,
/// that has string values that can be extracted to provide information for a tracing span.
///
/// Typically the library adopting instrumentation, would provide an implementation of this type, since it is aware of its carrier type. 
/// Which then can be combined with instrumentation or tracing implementations, which are not aware of the concrete carrier, and only provide an ``Instrument`` (or `Tracer`) which makes use of injector/extractor to operate on carrier values.
