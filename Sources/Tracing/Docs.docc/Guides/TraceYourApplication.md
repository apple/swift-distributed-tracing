# Trace Your Application

## Overview

This guide is aimed at **application developers** who have some server-side system and want to make use of distributed tracing
in order to improve their understanding and facilitate performance tuning and debugging their services in production or development.

Distributed tracing offers a way to gain additional insight into how your application is performing in production, without having to reconstruct the "big picture" from manually piecing together log lines and figuring out what happened
after what else and _why_. Distributed traces, as the name implies, also span multiple nodes in a micro-service architecture
or clustered system, and provide a profiler-like experience to debugging the handling of a "request" or otherwise defined span.

### Setting up instruments & tracers

As an end-user building server applications you get to choose what instruments to use to instrument your system. Here are
all the steps you need to take to get up and running:

Add a package dependency for this repository in your `Package.swift` file, and one for the specific instrument you want
to use, in this case `FancyInstrument`:

```swift
// depend on some instrumentation library:
.package(url: "<example-fancy-instrument.git>", from: "<1.2.3>"),

// which generally will already depend on the tracing API,
// however you can depend on it explicitly as well:
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing.git", from: 1.0.0),
```

To your main target, add a dependency on the `Instrumentation library` and the instrument you want to use:

```swift
.target(
    name: "MyApplication",
    dependencies: [
      .product(name: "FancyInstrument", package: "example-fancy-instrument"),
    ]
),
```

### Bootstrapping the `InstrumentationSystem`

Instead of providing each instrumented library with a specific instrument explicitly, you *bootstrap* the
`InstrumentationSystem` which acts as a singleton that libraries/frameworks access when calling out to the configured
`Instrument`:

```swift
InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(FancyInstrument())
```

#### Recommended bootstrap order

Swift offers developers a suite of observability libraries: logging, metrics and tracing. Each of those systems offers a `bootstrap` function. It is useful to stick to a recommended boot order in order to achieve predictable initialization of applications and sub-systems.

Specifically, it is recommended to bootstrap systems in the following order:

1. [Swift Log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log#default-logger-behavior)'s `LoggingSystem`
2. [Swift Metrics](https://github.com/apple/swift-metrics#selecting-a-metrics-backend-implementation-applications-only)' `MetricsSystem`
3. Swift Tracing's `InstrumentationSystem`
4. Finally, any other parts of your application

This is because tracing systems may attempt to emit metrics about their status etc.

#### Bootstrapping multiple instruments using MultiplexInstrument

It is important to note that `InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(_: InstrumentProtocol)` must only be called once. In case you
want to bootstrap the system to use multiple instruments, you group them in a `MultiplexInstrument` first, which you
then pass along to the `bootstrap` method like this:

```swift
InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(MultiplexInstrument([FancyInstrument(), OtherFancyInstrument()]))
```

`MultiplexInstrument` will then call out to each instrument it has been initialized with.

### Context propagation, by explicit `FIXME!!!` passing

> `FIXME!!!` naming has been carefully selected and it reflects the type's purpose and utility: It binds a [Swift Log `Logger`](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) with an associated distributed tracing [Baggage](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage).
>
> It _also_ is used for tracing, by tracers reaching in to read or modify the carried baggage.

For instrumentation and tracing to work, certain pieces of metadata (usually in the form of identifiers), must be
carried throughout the entire system–including across process and service boundaries. Because of that, it's essential
for a context object to be passed around your application and the libraries/frameworks you depend on, but also carried
over asynchronous boundaries like an HTTP call to another service of your app.

`FIXME!!!` should always be passed around explicitly.

Libraries which support tracing are expected to accept a `FIXME!!!` parameter, which can be passed through the entire application. Make sure to always pass along the context that's previously handed to you. E.g., when making an HTTP request using `AsyncHTTPClient` in a `NIO` handler, you can use the `ChannelHandlerContext`s `baggage` property to access the `FIXME!!!`.

#### Context argument naming/positioning

> 💡 This general style recommendation has been ironed out together with the Swift standard library, core team, the SSWG as well as members of the community. Please respect these recommendations when designing APIs such that all APIs are able to "feel the same" yielding a great user experience for our end users ❤️
>
> It is possible that the ongoing Swift Concurrency efforts and "Task Local" values will resolve this explicit context passing problem, however until these arrive in the language, please adopt the "context is the last parameter" style as outlined here.

Propagating baggage context through your system is to be done explicitly, meaning as a parameter in function calls, following the "flow" of execution.

When passing baggage context explicitly we strongly suggest sticking to the following style guideline:

- Assuming the general parameter ordering of Swift function is as follows (except DSL exceptions):
  1. Required non-function parameters (e.g. `(url: String)`),
  2. Defaulted non-function parameters (e.g. `(mode: Mode = .default)`),
  3. Required function parameters, including required trailing closures (e.g. `(onNext elementHandler: (Value) -> ())`),
  4. Defaulted function parameters, including optional trailing closures (e.g. `(onComplete completionHandler: (Reason) -> ()) = { _ in }`).
- Logging Context should be passed as **the last parameter in the required non-function parameters group in a function declaration**.

This way when reading the call side, users of these APIs can learn to "ignore" or "skim over" the context parameter and the method signature remains human-readable and “Swifty”.

Examples:

- `func request(_ url: URL,` **`context: FIXME!!!`** `)`, which may be called as `httpClient.request(url, context: context)`
- `func handle(_ request: RequestObject,` **`context: FIXME!!!`**`)`
  - if a "framework context" exists and _carries_ the baggage context already, it is permitted to pass that context
    together with the baggage;
  - it is _strongly recommended_ to store the baggage context as `baggage` property of `FrameworkContext`, and conform `FrameworkContext` to `FIXME!!!` in such cases, in order to avoid the confusing spelling of `context.context`, and favoring the self-explanatory `context.baggage` spelling when the baggage is contained in a framework context object.
- `func receiveMessage(_ message: Message, context: FrameworkContext)`
- `func handle(element: Element,` **`context: FIXME!!!`** `, settings: Settings? = nil)`
  - before any defaulted non-function parameters
- `func handle(element: Element,` **`context: FIXME!!!`** `, settings: Settings? = nil, onComplete: () -> ())`
  - before defaulted parameters, which themselfes are before required function parameters
- `func handle(element: Element,` **`context: FIXME!!!`** `, onError: (Error) -> (), onComplete: (() -> ())? = nil)`

In case there are _multiple_ "framework-ish" parameters, such as passing a NIO `EventLoop` or similar, we suggest:

- `func perform(_ work: Work, for user: User,` _`frameworkThing: Thing, eventLoop: NIO.EventLoop,`_ **`context: FIXME!!!`**`)`
  - pass the baggage as **last** of such non-domain specific parameters as it will be _by far more_ omnipresent than any
    specific framework parameter - as it is expected that any framework should be accepting a context if it can do so.
    While not all libraries are necessarily going to be implemented using the same frameworks.

We feel it is important to preserve Swift's human-readable nature of function definitions. In other words, we intend to
keep the read-out-loud phrasing of methods to remain _"request that URL (ignore reading out loud the context parameter)"_
rather than _"request (ignore this context parameter when reading) that URL"_.

#### When to use what context type?

Generally libraries should favor accepting the general `FIXME!!!` type, and **not** attempt to wrap it, as it will result in difficult to compose APIs between multiple libraries. Because end users are likely going to be combining various libraries in a single application, it is important that they can "just pass along" the same context object through all APIs, regardless which other library they are calling into.

Frameworks may need to be more opinionated here, and e.g. already have some form of "per request context" contextual object which they will conform to `FIXME!!!`. _Within_ such framework it is fine and expected to accept and pass the explicit `SomeFrameworkContext`, however when designing APIs which may be called _by_ other libraries, such framework should be able to accept a generic `FIXME!!!` rather than its own specific type.

#### Existing context argument

When adapting an existing library/framework to support `FIXME!!!` and it already has a "framework context" which is expected to be passed through "everywhere", we suggest to follow these guidelines for adopting FIXME!!!:

1. Add a `Baggage` as a property called `baggage` to your own `context` type, so that the call side for your
   users becomes `context.baggage` (rather than the confusing `context.context`)
2. If you cannot or it would not make sense to carry baggage inside your framework's context object, pass (and accept (!)) the `FIXME!!!` in your framework functions like follows:
- if they take no framework context, accept a `context: FIXME!!!` which is the same guideline as for all other cases
- if they already _must_ take a context object and you are out of words (or your API already accepts your framework context as "context"), pass the baggage as **last** parameter (see above) yet call the parameter `baggage` to disambiguate your `context` object from the `baggage` context object.

Examples:

- `Lambda.Context` may contain `baggage` and a `logger` and should be able to conform to `FIXME!!!`
  - passing context to a `Lambda.Context` unaware library becomes: `http.request(url: "...", context: context)`.
- `ChannelHandlerContext` offers a way to set/get baggage on the underlying channel via `context.baggage = ...`
  - this context is not passed outside a handler, but within it may be passed as is, and the baggage may be accessed on it directly through it.
  - Example: [https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/1574](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/1574)

### Creating context objects (and when not to do so)

Generally application developers _should not_ create new context objects, but rather keep passing on a context value that they were given by e.g. the web framework invoking the their code.

If really necessary, or for the purposes of testing, one can create a baggage or context using one of the two factory functions:

- [`DefaultFIXME!!!.topLevel(logger:)`](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage/blob/main/Sources/Baggage/FIXME!!!.swift) or [`Baggage.topLevel`](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage-core/blob/main/Sources/CoreBaggage/Baggage.swift) - which creates an empty context/baggage, without any values. It should _not_ be used too frequently, and as the name implies in applications it only should be used on the "top level" of the application, or at the beginning of a contextless (e.g. timer triggered) event processing.
- [`DefaultFIXME!!!.TODO(logger:reason:)`](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage/blob/main/Sources/Baggage/FIXME!!!.swift) or [`Baggage.TODO`](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing-baggage-core/blob/main/Sources/CoreBaggage/Baggage.swift) - which should be used to mark a parameter where "before this code goes into production, a real context should be passed instead." An application can be run with `-DBAGGAGE_CRASH_TODOS` to cause the application to crash whenever a TODO context is still in use somewhere, making it easy to diagnose and avoid breaking context propagation by accidentally leaving in a `TODO` context in production.

Please refer to the respective functions documentation for details.

If using a framework which itself has a "`...Context`" object you may want to inspect it for similar factory functions, as `FIXME!!!` is a protocol, that may be conformed to by frameworks to provide a smoother user experience.

### Working with `Span`s

The primary way you interact with distributed tracing is by starting ``Span``s.

Spans form hierarchies with their parent spans, and end up being visualized using various tools, usually in a format similar to gant charts. So for example, if we had multiple operations that compose making dinner, they would be modelled as child spans of a main `makeDinner` span. Any sub tasks are again modelled as child spans of any given operation, and so on, resulting in a trace view similar to:

```
>-v-v-v----- makeDinner ------------------------v---------------x  [15s]
  \-|-|- chopVegetables------v---x              |                  [2s]
    | |  \- chop-carrot ---x |                  |                  [1s]
    | |                      \--- chop-potato-x |                  [1s]
    \-|- marinateMeat -----------x              |                  [3s]
      \- preheatOven ------------x              |                  [10s]
                                                \--cook---------x  [5s]
```

The above trace is achieved by starting and ending spans in all the mentioned functions.

```swift
let tracer: any TracerProtocol

func makeDinner() async throws -> Meal {
  tracer.withSpan("makeDinner", context) { 
    async let veggiesFuture = try chopVegetables()
    async let meatFuture = marinateMeat()
    async let ovenFuture = try preheatOven(temperature: 350)
    // ...
    return try await cook(veggies, meat, oven)
  }
}

func chopVegetables() async throws {
  await tracer.withSpan("chopVegetables", context) {
    try await chop(.carrot) 
    try await chop(.potato) 
  }
}
func chop(_ vegetable: Vegetable) async {
  await tracer.withSpan("chop-\(vegetable)", context) {
    // ...
  }
}

func marinateMeat() {
  tracer.withSpan("marinateMeat", context) {
    // ... 
  }
}

// ... 
```

The preferr

> ❗️ It is tremendously important to **always `end()` a started ``Span``**! make sure to end any started span on _every_ code path, including error paths
>
> Failing to do so is an error, and a tracer *may* decide to either crash the application or log warnings when an not-ended span is deinitialized.
